# data-analysis
Implemented various ML models from scratch in Python (absolute zero use of sklearn) 

decisionTree.py - Implemented the recursive partitioning algorithm for decision trees using entropy to determine the best split

kmeans.py - Implemented the popular assign-update centroid algorithm for kmeans clustering for given number of iterations

linearRegression.py - Implemented linear regression using gradient descent and closed form solution to update the weights

logisticRegression.py - Implemented logistic regression using gradient descent to update the weights

bayesian.py - Compute various bayesian statistics, such as MAP estimate, posterior with finite hypothesis and posterior with beta prior

Data.py - Generate dataset for each of the models
